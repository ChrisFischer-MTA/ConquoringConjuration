Specaial notes for use:
> 1. You must use this in Visual Studio or any Windows Specific C++ Compiler. This program references Windows default library - meaning that platform neutral IDEs such as Dev C++ will NOT work without extra elbow grease.
> 2. You must set your Character Type to not set - demonstrated in https://github.com/ChrisFischer-MTA/ConquoringConjuration/blob/master/project_Settings.PNG?raw=true - we are working with Windows specific types, Windows doesn't convert TCHAR_ seemlessly to ASCII/UNICODE/DBCS although it's a loose-type macro.
