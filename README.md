## ConquoringConjuration

 
 
Specaial notes for use:
> 1. You must use this in Visual Studio or any Windows Specific C++ Compiler. This program references Windows default library - meaning that platform neutral IDEs such as Dev C++ will NOT work without extra elbow grease.
> 2. You must set your Character Type to not set - demonstrated in https://github.com/ChrisFischer-MTA/ConquoringConjuration/blob/master/project_Settings.PNG?raw=true - we are working with Windows specific types, Windows doesn't convert TCHAR_ seemlessly to ASCII/UNICODE/DBCS although it's a loose-type macro. 


# What is this?
I used to play Wizard101 when I was twelve. (Wizard101 is a MMORPG: massively multiplayer online role-playing game). I always played around in cheat engine to modify values, earn gold, etc. This is me revisitng the project some years later and making something actually cool.

# Tools Used

x32 Dbg - Used for mapping the memory, pulling out the structs of the DLL that is loaded in. 

Cheat Engine - Used initially to freeze time, and find the values of the cards.

Process Monitor - Used to find server communication, enumerate the anti-cheat, and figure out the logging the game was doing.

# Special Thanks
Shoutout to MSDN for having a function I could just steal.

Thanks for Mr. Singer (Freedom) for providing me the encouragement throughout the project.


Thanks to Mr. Raymond Enger (Valencia) for accepting it as extra credit work.
